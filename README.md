# Mathematical Escape Room Toolkit

Welcome to the **Mathematical Escape Room Toolkit** repository! This project contains all the resources, instructions, and materials needed to create, set up, and run a mathematical escape room. Designed to excite and motivate participants of all ages, this escape room showcases how mathematics can be engaging, immersive, and fun.

## Contents

### 1. Overview
The escape room is set during **World War Two**, inspired by the legendary Alan Turing and his work at **Station X** (Bletchley Park). Participants take on the role of codebreakers, solving puzzles to avert disaster while learning problem-solving, teamwork, and mathematical concepts.

### 2. Features
- **Portable Design**: All components fit into a small kit for easy transport. You can set up the escape room anywhere, from a classroom to a theatre or even a broom cupboard.
- **Accessibility**: Designed for inclusivity, with minimal text and intuitive puzzles requiring no prior mathematical knowledge.
- **Modular Setup**: Reset quickly between sessions. Scalable for groups of 6â€“8 participants per room.

### 3. Requirements
- **Materials**: A desk, chair, and basic off-the-shelf equipment such as locks, markers, and props.
- **Tools**: A printer for puzzle materials and optionally a laminator for durability.
- **Software**: Adobe Reader (or similar) for PDFs; optional tools for managing timers.
